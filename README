Tie-Handle-CSV
==============

Makes basic access to CSV files easier. When you read from the file handle, a
hash or an array is returned depending on whether headers exist or do not.

Regardless of the type of the returned data, when it is converted to a string,
it automatically converts back to CSV format.

   use strict;
   use warnings;

   use Tie::Handle::CSV;

   my $csv_fh = Tie::Handle::CSV->new('basic.csv', header => 1);

   while (my $csv_line = <$csv_fh>)
      {
      $csv_line->{'salary'} *= 1.05;    ## give a 5% raise
      print $csv_line, "\n";            ## print modified CSV line to STDOUT
      }

   close $csv_fh;
