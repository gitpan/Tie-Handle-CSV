Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Handle::CSV.

0.05  Sat Apr 03 2004
     - documented auto-croak behavior properly
     - when 'READLINE' is called and 'wantarray' is true, call 'READLINE'
       repeatedly in scalar context. this will allow proper behavior in
       inherited classes.  previously we just looped over the filehandle
       internally.
